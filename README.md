---

### Desciption

The purpose of this project was to utilize various JavaScript features; like event listeners, accessing DOM elements and conditional statements to create a random password generator.

JavaScript features used for this project:

> - Creating and using functions
> - Using conditional statements (if statements) to populate the userChoice array with parameters chosen for the password generation.
> - Using an object to better structure the code's properties used to generate the user's password.
> - Using a for loop that actually generates the password after the user choices have been chosen and stored.
> - Utilized the DOM web API to incorporate a button the user can click to start the password generation process.
> - Generator an event listener to listen for the user to click the generate password butto to initiate the generatePassword function.
